DESCRIPTION
This plugin can transform textual options (in the form FOO|BAR, as they are
often found in templates or snippets) into a printed list or insert-mode
completion, which offer all alternatives ("FOO" and "BAR" in this example),
and allow to choose one and replace the full options block with it.

USAGE
q|                      List all individual alternatives in the text form
                        close to the cursor and allow the user to choose one,
                        which then replaces the full options block.
{Visual}q|              List all individual alternatives in the selected text
{Select}CTRL-X |        form and allow the user to choose one, which then
                        replaces the selection.
[count]q|               Replace the full options block / selection with the
{Visual}[count]q|       [count]'th alternative from it.

CTRL-X |                Convert the text form before the cursor into the
                        individual alternatives and offer them for completion.

SYNTAX
The text forms can be in simple and extended syntax. The simple syntax is just
a list of word characters (without whitespace!), delimited by | characters:
    FOO|BAZ|QUUX
You can include [], (), + and |, too, but you have to escape with a backslash.

The extended syntax is bracketed by [...], and its alternatives can contain
whitespace and any other characters.
    [FOO+BAR|My BAZ|The QUUX!]
Additionally, you can append an optional explanation to each alternative. This
will only be shown in the completion menu, but is not inserted into the
buffer. The explanation must be enclosed in (...) and comes after the
alternative text, separated by a <Space>:
    [FOO (default)|BAZ (softer)|QUUX (the special choice)]
